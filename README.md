# Fullstack application with Node, Express, React, Redux and Mongo

In this project, we are going to create a fullstack web application where users
will be able to send customers e-mails requesting feedback, then get back a
tabulation of results.

### Installing

First off, create a git repository if you don't have one, then create a folder
named "server" on it. cd into it and run the following commands:

```
$: npm init
```

Press enter to accept all the defaults of "npm init", this create a package.json
file that tracks all the project's dependencies. Afterwards, you will run the
following command to install express:

```
npm install --save express
```

## index.js

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Heroku

We are going to use Heroku as our cloud server, we can intall the heroku-cli
from npm and just login into it.. Then we can add a remote called heroku with
the provided link after we run the heroku create, if needed

```
Give an example
```

### Naming Conventions

On components that return an object, we are going to capitalize the first letter,
on components that return a function we will use camelCase

```
Give an example
```
